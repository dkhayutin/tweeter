# Tweeter Project


Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. It was designed and completed during week three of my bootcamp at Lighthouse Labs. The primary focus of this project was to improve my skillset in HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, Node, Express and MongoDB back-end skills.

Individuals who visit Tweeter are able to like individual posts by clicking on the heart icon. It will add a like for that to post the Mongo Database. When the Tweeter page is refreshed, hovering the mouse over the heart icon allows individuals to see the amount of times each post has been liked.

You can visit the live version Tweeter at https://still-beyond-98025.herokuapp.com/
