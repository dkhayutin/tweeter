# Tweeter Project


Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. It was designed and completed during week three of my bootcamp at Lighthouse Labs. The primary focus of this project was to improve my skillset in HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, Node, Express and MongoDB back-end skills.
